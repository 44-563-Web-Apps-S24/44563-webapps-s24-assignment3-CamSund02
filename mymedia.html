  <h2>Code Snippet</h2>
  <p>This code defines a Python decorator that implements the Singleton pattern, and it is applied to a class called TestClass</p>
  <pre>def singleton(myClass):
	instances = {}
	def getInstance(*args, **kwargs):
		if myClass not in instances:
			instances[myClass] = myClass(*args, **kwargs)
		return instances[myClass]
	return getInstance

@singleton
class TestClass(object):
	pass
</pre>
